00:00:51,JOY: Do you ever look at someone and wonder...
00:00:53,"""What is going on inside their head?"""
00:00:56,"Well, I know. Well, I know Riley's head."
00:01:05,(BABY COOING)
00:01:35,Hmm?
00:01:40,(BABY COOING HAPPILY)
00:01:44,JOY: And there she was...
00:01:48,Hello. Riley.
00:01:52,"Oh, look at you."
00:01:54,Aren't you a little bundle of joy?
00:01:58,(BELL DINGS)
00:02:07,Aren't you a little bundle of joy?
00:02:10,Whoa.
00:02:27,(RILEY COOING)
00:02:30,JOY: It was amazing. Just Riley and me. Forever.
00:02:38,(RILEY CRYING)
00:02:41,"JOY: Err, for 33 seconds?"
00:02:45,I'm Sadness.
00:02:47,"Oh, hello. I... I'm Joy. So..."
00:02:51,Can I just... If you could...
00:02:53,I just want to fix that. Thanks.
00:02:55,JOY: And that was just the beginning.
00:02:57,Headquarters only got more crowded from there.
00:03:00,(LAUGHING)
00:03:02,"Very nice. Okay, looks like you got this. Very good."
00:03:05,"FEAR: Whoa, sharp turn! No! Look out! No!"
00:03:06,JOY: That's Fear.
00:03:07,He's really good at keeping Riley safe.
00:03:10,"FEAR: Easy, easy. Ah!"
00:03:12,"(EXCLAIMS) Oh, we're good. We're good."
00:03:15,Whew! Good job. Thank you. Thank you very much.
00:03:16,And we're back! (RILEY LAUGHING)
00:03:18,(GLASS SHATTERS) Oh!
00:03:22,"Here we go. All right, open."
00:03:24,Hmm. This looks new. You think it's safe?
00:03:26,What is it? Aah.
00:03:27,"Okay, caution. There is a dangerous smell, people."
00:03:30,Hold on. What is that? JOY: This is Disgust.
00:03:32,She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned.
00:03:35,Physically and socially
00:03:36,That is not brightly colored
00:03:37,"or shaped like a dinosaur. Hold on, guys."
00:03:39,It's broccoli! (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST)
00:03:40,Yucky!
00:03:43,"Well, I just saved our lives."
00:03:45,BOTH: Whew! Yeah. You're welcome.
00:03:46,"Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,"
00:03:48,you're not gonna get any dessert.
00:03:49,Wait. Did he just say we couldn't have dessert?
00:03:52,JOY: That's Anger.
00:03:53,He cares very deeply about things being fair.
00:03:56,"So that's how you want to play it, old man?"
00:03:58,"No dessert? Oh, sure, we'll eat our dinner!"
00:04:01,Right after you eat this!

00:04:13,ALL: Oh! Airplane.
00:04:23,"JOY: And you've met Sadness. She... Well, she..."
00:04:26,(CRYING)
00:04:31,JOY: I'm not actually sure what she does.
00:04:33,"And I've checked,"
00:04:34,"there's no place for her to go, so..."
00:04:35,"She's good, we're good. It's all great!"
00:04:38,"Anyway, these are Riley's memories"
00:04:40,"and they're mostly happy, you'll notice. Not to brag."
00:04:43,MEG: Whoo-hoo! (RILEY LAUGHING)
00:04:45,Whoo-hoo!
00:04:48,JOY: But the really important ones are over here.
00:04:51,"I don't want to get too technical,"
00:04:52,but these are called Core Memories.
00:04:55,Each one came from a super important time in Riley's life.
00:04:58,"Uh, like when she first scored a goal."
00:05:00,"Oh, that was so amazing!"
00:05:01,Hey! Would you look at that? Very nice!
00:05:04,We got a future center here! Nice job.
00:05:05,(ALL CHEERING)
00:05:18,JOY: And each Core Memory
00:05:19,powers a different aspect of Riley's personality.
00:05:22,Like Hockey Island.
00:05:27,Goofball Island is my personal favorite.
00:05:29,"Ah, come back here, you little monkey!"
00:05:33,"DAD: (LAUGHING) Oh, you're silly."
00:05:34,"JOY: Yep, Goofball is the best."
00:05:37,Friendship Island is pretty good too.
00:05:39,(BOTH GIGGLING)
00:05:41,"JOY: Oh, I love Honesty Island."
00:05:44,And that's the truth!
00:05:45,"And of course, Family Island is amazing."
00:05:48,(INDISTINCT)
00:05:50,"JOY: The point is, the Islands of Personality"
00:05:52,are what make Riley... Riley!

00:06:30,"Good night, kiddo."
00:06:31,"Good night, Dad."
00:06:37,And... we're out!
00:06:41,JOY: That's what I'm talking about!
00:06:42,Whoo! Another perfect day!
00:06:44,"Nice job, everybody!"
00:06:45,Let's get those memories down to Long Term.
00:06:52,"All right, we did not die today!"
00:06:54,I call that an unqualified success.
00:07:11,JOY: And that's it. We love our girl.
00:07:14,She's got great friends and a great house.
00:07:16,Things couldn't be better.
00:07:18,"After all, Riley's 11 now."
00:07:21,What could happen?
00:07:24,What... ALL: Aah!

00:07:56,"JOY: Hey, look! The Golden Gate Bridge!"
00:07:58,Isn't that great?
00:08:00,"It's not made out of solid gold like we thought,"
00:08:02,"which is kind of a disappointment, but still..."
00:08:04,"FEAR: I sure am glad you told me earthquakes are a myth, Joy."
00:08:06,Otherwise I'd be terrified right now! (CHUCKLES)
00:08:09,"Uh, yeah..."
00:08:10,WOMAN: Are you kidding? Get out of the street!
00:08:12,"(CARS HONKING) MAN: Oh, for Pete's sake! Move it!"
00:08:13,These are my kind of people. (CARS HONKING)
00:08:15,"DAD: All right, just a few more blocks."
00:08:17,We're almost to our new house!
00:08:18,"Step on it, Daddy!"
00:08:19,Why don't we just live in this smelly car?
00:08:21,We've already been in it forever.
00:08:22,"Which, actually, was really lucky,"
00:08:24,because that gave us plenty of time to think about
00:08:26,what our new house is going to look like!
00:08:28,What! Let's review the top five daydreams.
00:08:31,Ooh! That looks safe! SADNESS: That one's nice.
00:08:33,"Oh, this will be great for Riley!"
00:08:34,"JOY: Oh, no, no, no, no, this one!"
00:08:36,"DISGUST: Oh, Joy, for the last time, she cannot live in a cookie."
00:08:38,ANGER: That's the one! It comes with a dragon.
00:08:41,"JOY: Now we're getting close, I can feel it."
00:08:44,"Here it is, here's our new house."
00:08:47,And...
00:08:54,Maybe it's nice on the inside.
00:08:57,(DOOR CREAKING)
00:09:02,ANGER: We're supposed to live here? SADNESS: Do we have to?
00:09:03,"DISGUST: I'm telling you, it smells like something died in here."
00:09:06,Can you die from moving?
00:09:07,"Guys, you're overreacting."
00:09:08,Nobody is dying...
00:09:10,A dead mouse! (FEAR SCREAMS)
00:09:11,ANGER: Great. This is just great. DISGUST: I'm gonna be sick.
00:09:13,It's the house of the dead! We're going to get rabies!
00:09:14,Get off of me! (FEAR SCREAMING)
00:09:16,"Hey. All through the drive,"
00:09:17,Dad talked about how cool our new room is.
00:09:19,(FEAR SIGHS) Let's go check it out!
00:09:20,DISGUST: Let's go! ANGER: It's gonna be great!
00:09:21,"FEAR: Yes, yes, yes."
00:09:23,"No, no, no, no, no."
00:09:24,DISGUST: I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.
00:09:25,"ANGER: Get out the rubber ball,"
00:09:26,we're in solitary confinement.
00:09:28,Riley can't live here.
00:09:29,She's right. It's the worst.
00:09:30,FEAR: Really bad. DISGUST: It's absolutely the worst.
00:09:31,DISGUST: It's the worst place I've ever been in my entire life.
00:09:34,"Hey, it's nothing our butterfly curtains couldn't fix."
00:09:37,I read somewhere that an empty room is an opportunity.
00:09:39,Where did you read that? It doesn't matter.
00:09:40,I read it and it's great.
00:09:41,We'll put the bed there.
00:09:43,JOY: And the desk over there.
00:09:44,FEAR: The hockey lamp goes there.
00:09:45,"ANGER: Uh, put the chair there."
00:09:46,JOY: The trophy collection goes there.
00:09:48,FEAR: Stars! I like that!
00:09:49,JOY: Now we're talking!
00:09:51,Let's go get our stuff from the moving van!
00:09:53,DAD: All right. Goodbye.
00:09:54,"Well, guess what?"
00:09:55,The moving van won't be here until Thursday.
00:09:57,You're kidding. Mmm-hmm.
00:09:59,The van is lost? It is the worst day ever!
00:10:01,DISGUST: That figures. The van is lost.
00:10:03,You said it would be here yesterday!
00:10:04,I know that's what I said. That's what they told me!
00:10:06,FEAR: Mom and Dad are stressed out!
00:10:07,ANGER: They're stressed out? FEAR: What are we going to do?
00:10:09,(ALL TALKING AT ONCE) I've got a great idea!

00:10:18,"DAD: Oh, no, you're not!"
00:10:19,She's lining up for the shot!

00:10:45,(SIGHS) All right. Stall for me.
00:10:47,I'll be right there.
00:10:48,"The investor's supposed to show up on Thursday,"
00:10:50,not today!
00:10:51,(SIGHS) I got to go.
00:10:53,It's okay. We get it.
00:10:54,"You're the best. Thanks, hon."
00:10:56,"See you, sweetie."
00:10:59,FEAR: Dad just left us.
00:11:00,He doesn't love us anymore.
00:11:02,That's sad.
00:11:03,"I should drive, right?"
00:11:05,Joy?
00:11:07,What are you doing?
00:11:08,"Uh, just give me one second."
00:11:10,"Um, you know what I've realized?"
00:11:12,Riley hasn't had lunch! Remember?
00:11:17,"Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street."
00:11:19,Maybe we could try that?
00:11:20,Pizza sounds delicious.
00:11:22,Pizza? That's good. Yes! Pizza!
00:11:26,FEAR: What the heck is that? JOY: Who puts broccoli on pizza?
00:11:28,That's it. I'm done.
00:11:30,"Congratulations, San Francisco,"
00:11:32,you've ruined pizza!
00:11:33,First the Hawaiians
00:11:35,and now you!
00:11:37,What kind of a pizza place only serves one kind of pizza?
00:11:39,"MOM: Must be a San Francisco thing, huh?"
00:11:42,"Still, it's not as bad as that soup."
00:11:44,"At that diner in Nebraska. Oh, yeah."
00:11:46,The spoon stood up in the soup by itself!
00:11:48,RILEY: That was disgusting.
00:11:50,"JOY: Oh, good. Family is running."
00:11:51,RILEY: Dad's got a steel stomach.
00:11:53,"The drive out was pretty fun, huh?"
00:11:54,What was your favorite part?
00:11:56,Spitting out the car window!
00:11:57,Definitely not when Dad was singing.
00:11:59,Wearing a seat belt!
00:12:00,Oh! What about the time with the dinosaur?
00:12:02,"Oh, that's the one. Definitely!"
00:12:04,DAD: Say cheese!
00:12:05,Dad! Dad! Honey!

00:12:14,I liked that time at the dinosaur.
00:12:15,That was pretty funny. (MOM LAUGHING)
00:12:21,(GASPS)
00:12:24,Wait. What? What happened?
00:12:27,FEAR: She did something to the memory.
00:12:30,What did you do? I just touched it.
00:12:32,"That shouldn't make it change. Change it back, Joy!"
00:12:34,I'm trying. You can't change it back?
00:12:36,"No! I guess I can't! Good going, Sadness."
00:12:38,"Now when Riley thinks of that moment with Dad,"
00:12:39,she's gonna feel sad.
00:12:41,"Bravo. I'm sorry, Joy."
00:12:42,I don't really know...
00:12:44,I thought maybe if you...
00:12:45,(STAMMERING)
00:12:47,"Joy, we've got a stairway coming up."
00:12:51,Just don't touch any other memories
00:12:53,until we figure out what's going on.
00:12:54,Okay. JOY: All right.
00:12:56,Get ready. This is a monster railing
00:12:58,and we are riding it all the way down!

00:13:10,(FEAR AND JOY GASP) A Core Memory!

00:13:18,so I opened it and then it fell out.
00:13:20,I...
00:13:25,Whoo-hoo!
00:13:26,It's just that... I wanted to maybe hold one.
00:13:29,"FEAR: Joy! Whoa, whoa!"

00:13:35,"And when you touch them, we can't change them back."
00:13:38,I know. I'm sorry.
00:13:39,Something's wrong with me.
00:13:41,It's like I'm having a breakdown.
00:13:43,You're not having a breakdown. It's stress.
00:13:45,I keep making mistakes like that. I'm awful.
00:13:48,"No, you're not. And annoying."
00:13:50,(STUTTERING) You know what?
00:13:52,You can't focus on what's going wrong.
00:13:54,"There's always a way to turn things around,"

00:13:57,Yeah. Find the fun.
00:14:00,I don't know how to do that.
00:14:01,"Okay. Well,"
00:14:02,try to think of something funny.
00:14:04,Um... Oh!
00:14:05,Remember the funny movie where the dog dies?
00:14:08,"Oh. Yeah, that's not..."
00:14:10,What about that time with Meg
00:14:12,when Riley laughed so hard
00:14:14,milk came out of her nose?
00:14:16,(LAUGHING)
00:14:18,Yeah. That hurt. It felt like fire.
00:14:21,"SADNESS: Ooh, it was awful."
00:14:23,"Okay, okay, don't think of that. Let's try something else."
00:14:24,"Uh, what are your favorite things to do?"
00:14:26,My favorite?
00:14:27,"Um... Well, I like it when we're outside."
00:14:30,That's good. Like there's the beach and sunshine.
00:14:33,Oh! Like that time
00:14:34,we buried Dad in the sand up to his neck.
00:14:36,SADNESS: I was thinking more like rain.
00:14:40,"Rain? Rain is my favorite, too!"
00:14:43,We can stomp around in puddles.
00:14:45,"JOY: You know, there's cool umbrellas, lightning storms."
00:14:48,SADNESS: More like when the rain runs down our back
00:14:50,and makes our shoes soggy.
00:14:52,"And we get all cold, shivery, and"
00:14:55,everything just starts feeling droopy. (CRYING)
00:14:58,"Oh, hey, hey. Hey, easy."
00:15:01,Why are you crying?
00:15:03,It's just like really the opposite of what we're going for here.
00:15:06,Crying helps me slow down and obsess
00:15:08,over the weight of life's problems.

00:16:39,Pizza is weird here. Our friends are back home.
00:16:41,And all of our stuff is in the missing van!
00:16:43,"Oh, come on. It could be worse."
00:16:45,"Yeah, Joy. We could be lying on the dirty floor. In a bag."
00:16:48,"Okay, I admit it, we had a rough start."
00:16:50,But think of all the good things that...
00:16:52,"No, Joy. There's absolutely no reason for Riley"
00:16:54,to be happy right now.
00:16:56,Let us handle this.
00:16:57,I say we skip school tomorrow
00:16:58,and lock ourselves in the bedroom.
00:17:00,"We have no clean clothes. I mean, no one should see us."
00:17:01,"Yeah, we could cry until we can't breathe."
00:17:03,We should lock the door and scream that curse word we know.
00:17:06,It's a good one! Now hold on!
00:17:08,"Look, we all have our off days."
00:17:10,"You know... Hi, honey."

00:17:49,"but if you and I can keep smiling,"
00:17:52,it would be a big help.

00:48:54,Once we flew back in time.
00:48:56,We had breakfast twice that day.
00:48:58,Sadness...
00:48:59,It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.
