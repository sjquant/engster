1:23:02,"Well, he's been right so far.",그건 맞는 말이야
1:23:07,What are you talking about?,무슨 소리야?
1:23:10,This place... it's not what we thought it was.,이곳은... 우리가 생각한 것과 달라
1:23:16,"It's not a prison, it's a test.",감옥이 아냐 일종의 시험장이지
1:23:20,It all started when we were kids.,우리가 어렸을 때 시작됐는데
1:23:23,They would give us these challenges.,다 그들이 고안한 테스트야
1:23:27,They were experimenting on us.,우린 그저 실험 대상이지
1:23:30,And then people started disappearing.,근데 사람들이 사라지기 시작했어
1:23:34,"Every month, one after the other, like clockwork.",매달 정확히 한명씩 차례대로
1:23:37,They were sending them up into the maze.,미로로 보낸 거군
1:23:39,"Yeah, but not all of us.",그래 하지만 전부는 아냐
1:23:42,What do you mean?,무슨 뜻이야?
1:23:44,"Guys, I'm one of them.",난 그들 일원이야
1:23:49,"The people who put you here, I worked with them.",너흴 여기 보낸 자들과 함께 일했었어
1:23:54,I watched you guys for years.,난 오랫동안 너희들을 지켜봤어
1:23:59,The entire time you have been here... I was on the other side of it.,너희들이 여기 있는 동안 난 반대쪽에 있었어
1:24:04,So were you.,너도 그렇고
1:24:09,What?,뭐라구?

1:24:19,That can't be true.,그럴리 없어
1:24:21,It is. I saw it.,사실이야. 내가 봤어.
1:24:25,Why would they send us up if we were with them?,우리가 그들 일원이라면 왜 여기로 보낸거지?
1:24:29,It doesn't matter.,이젠 상관없어
1:24:31,He's right. It doesn't matter.,토마스 말이 맞아. 이젠 상관없지.
1:24:34,Any of it. Because the people we were before the maze don't even exist anymore. These Creators took care of that.,이 모든 게... 미로에 오기 전의 우리는 이제 존재하지 않아. 예전 기억은 다 지워졌으니까.
1:24:48,"But what does matter is who we are now, and what we do...right now.","지금 우리가 누구이고, 무엇을 하는가가 중요한거야."
1:24:55,You went into the maze and you found a way out.,넌 미로에 들어갔고 나갈 길을 찾아냈어
1:24:59,"Yeah, but if I hadn't, Alby would still be alive.",내가 안 들어갔으면 알비가 안 죽었겠지
1:25:02,Maybe.,어쩌면...
1:25:07,"But I know that if he were here, he would be telling you the exact same thing.",하지만 살아있었다면 나와 똑같은 말을 했겠지
1:25:15,Pick your ass up and finish what you started.,어서 일어나서 네가 시작한 것을 끝내
1:25:20,"Because if we do nothing... then that means Alby died for nothing, and I can't have that.",왜냐면 우리가 가만히 있으면 알비는 헛되이 죽은 거고 난 그럴 수 없어.
1:25:27,Okay.,그래
1:25:33,"Okay, but we gotta get through Gally first.",그러려면 먼저 갤리부터 상대해야 돼
1:25:38,This is such a waste.,안타깝지만 할 수 없지
1:26:09,"Gally... It doesn't feel right, man.",갤리... 이건 옳지 않은 것 같아
1:26:22,"Yeah, what if Thomas is right?",만약 토마스가 옳다면?
1:26:26,Maybe he can lead us home.,우릴 집에 데려다줄지도 몰라
1:26:29,We are home.,우리 집은 여기야
1:26:33,Okay?,알았어?
1:26:35,I don't wanna have to cross any more names off that wall.,저 벽에 딴애들 이름을 지우긴 싫다구
1:26:40,You really think banishing us is gonna solve anything?,우릴 추방한다고 다 해결될 것 같아?
1:26:44,No.,아니
1:26:46,But this isn't a banishing.,추방하려는 게 아냐
1:26:49,It's an offering.,제물로 바치는 거지
1:26:51,What? Wait!,뭐라구?

1:26:59,Look around you!,주위를 둘러봐
1:27:02,Look at our Glade!,글레이드를 보라구
1:27:05,This is the only way.,이게 유일한 방법이야
1:27:09,And when the Grievers get what they came here for... everything goes back to the way it was.,그리버들이 원하는 걸 얻으면 모든 게 옛날로 돌아갈 거야.
1:27:15,Are you listening to this? Why are you all just standing there? He's crazy!,얘 말을 믿어? 왜 그렇게들 섰어? 얜 미쳤어!
1:27:17,You shut up.,닥쳐

1:27:59,"You don't have to come with us, but we are leaving.",원한다면 남아도 좋지만 우린 갈 거야
1:28:02,"Anyone else who wants to come, now is your last chance.",우리랑 가고 싶다면 이게 마지막 기회야
1:28:04,"Don't listen to him, he's just trying to scare you.",듣지 마 겁주는 거야
1:28:06,"No, I'm not trying to scare you. You're already scared.",그럴 필요가 없지 벌써 겁에 질렸으니까
1:28:09,I'm scared.,나도 무섭지만
1:28:11,But I'd rather risk my life out there than spending the rest of it in here.,여기서 평생을 사느니 차라리 미로에서 죽겠어
1:28:16,We don't belong here.,우리가 있을 곳은 여기가 아냐.
1:28:21,This place isn't our home.,여긴 우리 집이 아니야.
1:28:24,We were put here. We were trapped here.,강제로 보내져서 갇혀있을 뿐이지
1:28:29,"At least, out there we have a choice. We can make it out of here.",미로에 들어가면 승산이 있어. 여길 벗어날 수 있어.
1:28:37,I know that.,내가 장담해
1:28:39,I'm sorry.,미안해
1:28:54,"Gally, it's over.","갤리, 다 끝났어"
1:29:10,Just come with us.,우리랑 같이 가자
1:29:15,Good luck against the Grievers.,그리버들하고 잘 싸워봐

1:35:44,So they were watching us.,정말 우릴 지켜보고 있었어
1:36:20,This whole time.,처음부터 끝까지...
1:36:23,Hello.,안녕하세요
1:36:50,My name is Doctor Ava Paige.,난 에바 페이지 박사예요
1:36:53,I'm Director of Operations of the World Catastrophe Killzone Department.,"위키드, 즉 킬존 테스트의 총책임자죠"
1:36:58,"If you're watching this, that means you have successfully completed the Maze Trials.",이걸 보는 여러분은 미로 테스트를 무사히 통과했어요.
1:37:03,I wish I could be there in person to congratulate you... but circumstances seem to have prevented it.,직접 축하해주고 싶지만 상황이 여의치를 않군요
1:37:12,"I'm sure by now, you must all be very confused...angry...frightened.",잘 알아요 모두 무척 혼란스럽겠죠. 화나고..무섭다는 거...
1:37:18,"I can only assure you, that everything that's happened to you... everything we've done to you... it was all done for a reason. You won't remember... but the Sun has scorched our world. Billions of lives lost to fire... famine... The fallout was unimaginable.suffering on a global scale.",하지만 여러분한테 일어났던 일.. 우리가 여러분한테 한 모든 일에는 그만한 이유가 있었죠. 기억 못하겠지만.. 태양이 우리 세상을 불태웠어요. 수십억 명이 희생됐죠 화재와 굶주림에... 전세계가 상상을 초월하는 끔찍한 고통을 겪었죠..
1:37:45,What came after was worse. We called it the Flare.,하지만 진짜 문제는 그 이후였어요. '플레어'가 퍼졌죠.
1:37:51,"A deadly virus that attacks the brain. It is violent... unpredictable... incurable. Or so we thought. In time, a new generation emerged that could survive the virus. Suddenly, there was a reason to hope for a cure. But finding it would not be easy.","뇌를 갉아먹는 치명적인 바이러스로 공격적이고 예측불가이며 치료가 불가능했죠. 그땐 그랬어요. 하지만 세월이 흘러 바이러스에 면역인 세대가 태어났고, 치료가 가능하단 희망이 생겼어요.. 하지만 쉽진 않을 거예요."
1:38:18,"The young would have to be tested, even sacrificed... inside harsh environments... where their brain activity could be studied. All in an effort to understand... what makes them different... what makes you different.","젊은이들을 혹독한 환경에 가둬놓고 각종 테스트를 통해 뇌의 활동을 연구해야 하니까.. 이 모든 것의 목적은 단 하나 그들이 왜 다른지, 여러분이 왜 다른지를 알아내는 거죠."
1:38:35,You may not realize it... but you're very important.,잘 모르겠지만 여러분은 우리에게 굉장히 중요한 존재예요.
1:38:41,"Unfortunately, your trials have only just begun.",유감스럽게도 테스트는 이제 시작일뿐이죠
1:38:44,"As you will no doubt soon discover, not everyone agrees with our methods.",물론 세상 모두가 우리 방식에 동의하진 않아요
1:38:48,"Progress is slow, people are scared.",과정은 더디고 사람들은 두려워하죠
1:38:52,It may be too late for us... for me... but not for you. The outside world awaits.,우리한텐 너무 늦었을지 몰라요.. 나한테는... 하지만 여러분은 다르죠. 바깥 세상이 여러분을 기다려요.
1:39:01,Remember... Wicked is good.,이걸 알아줘요... 위키드는 좋은 일을 하는 거예요.
1:39:34,Is it over?,그럼 끝난 거야?
1:39:45,She said we were important.,저 여자는 우리가 중요하댔어
1:39:49,What are we supposed to do now?,이젠 어떡해야 되지?
1:39:52,I don't know.,모르겠어
1:40:02,Let's get out of here.,여기서 나가자
1:40:10,No.,안돼
1:40:13,Gally?,갤리?
1:40:13,Don't.,안돼
1:40:20,He's been stung.,그리버한테 찔렸어
1:40:28,We can't leave.,우린 못 나가
1:40:31,"We did. Gally, we're out.","우린 해냈어, 갤리 나왔다구"
1:40:38,We're free.,이젠 자유야
1:40:40,Free?,자유?
1:40:43,You think we're free out there?,나가면 자유로워질 것 같아?
1:40:49,No.,아니
1:40:51,"No, there's no escape from this place.",여기서 도망치는 건 불가능해
1:40:56,"Gally, listen to me.","갤리, 잘 들어"
1:41:02,You're not thinking straight.,넌 지금 제정신이 아냐
1:41:05,You're not.,정상이 아니라구
1:41:07,"Now, we can help you.",우리가 도와줄게
1:41:10,Just put down the gun.,그러니까 총을 내려놔
1:41:13,I belong to the maze.,내가 있을 곳은 미로야
1:41:15,Just put down the gun.,총을 내려놔
1:41:30,Thomas...,토마스
1:41:47,"Oh, shit. Shit.",빌어먹을...
1:41:54,"Look at me, look at me!",날 봐
1:41:56,"Oh, shit!",빌어먹을
1:41:58,"Chuck, look at me, all right?","척, 날 좀 봐"
1:42:00,"I got you, buddy. Just hang on.",괜찮을 거야 조금만 참아
1:42:02,It's okay.,괜찮아
1:42:04,"Thomas, Thomas...","토마스, 토마스"
1:42:06,"No, Chuck. You're gonna give it to them yourself.","아니, 척 네가 직접 부모님께 드려."
1:42:13,"Remember, I told you that.",전에 말했잖아
1:42:13,Take it.,어서 받아
1:42:16,No.,안돼
1:42:18,Thank you.,고마워
1:42:21,Thank you.,고마워
1:42:26,"No, Chuck, you're gonna get...","척, 치료 받으면..."
1:42:31,Chuck.,척
1:42:33,Chuck? Hey.,척? 정신차려
1:42:38,"Hey, Chuck, come on!","척, 정신차려"
1:42:41,"Come on, wake up!",정신차리란 말야
1:42:48,Damn it!,젠장!
1:42:53,We made it. Come on.,우리가 해냈잖아 제발!
1:42:58,I'm sorry!,미안해
1:43:04,God damn it!,젠장!
1:43:07,Damn it!,젠장!
1:43:17,"Get up, Chuck! Come on!","일어나, 척 제발!"
1:43:38,You can't just leave him there!,척도 데려가야 돼!
1:43:41,You guys all right?,다 괜찮냐?
1:44:20,Don't worry.,걱정 마
1:44:22,You're safe now.,이젠 안전해
1:44:24,"Relax, kid.",걱정 마
1:45:02,Everything is gonna change.,모든 게 바뀔 거야
1:45:06,I think it's safe to say the Maze Trials were a complete success.,미로 테스트는 완전한 성공이었어요
1:45:24,"I wasn't expecting so many survivors, but... the more the merrier.",그렇게 많이 살아남을 줄 몰랐지만... 많을수록 좋죠
1:45:30,Thomas continues to surprise and impress.,토마스는 역시 계속해서 우릴 놀라게 하네요
1:45:38,"And for now, they seem to have taken the bait.",현재로선 모두들 우리 미끼를 문 것 같군요
1:45:43,It's too soon to say... but they could be the key to everything.,아직 단정짓기엔 이르지만 그 아이들이 치료제 개발의 열쇠예요.
1:45:50,So let's move forward. It's time now to begin Phase Two.,그러니 테스트를 계속하죠. 이제 2단계를 시작할 때가 됐어요.
